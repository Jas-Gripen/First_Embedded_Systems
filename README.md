# Embedded_Systems
This is the first embedded system I worked with where I experimented with I2C, SPI and UART. The microcontroller I worked with was the STM32L4. All of the code was written in CubeMX which generated the initialization code for the peripherals according to my specifications. The interesting files are in 
IS1300_Embedded_Systems/Core/Src/ and 
IS1300_Embedded_Systems/Core/Inc/
