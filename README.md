# IS1300_Embedded_Systems
In this course I wrote code for an embedded system on the STM32L4. The code was written in CubeMX which generated the initialization code for the peripherals according to my specifications. The interesting files are in 
IS1300_Embedded_Systems/Core/Src/ and 
IS1300_Embedded_Systems/Core/Inc/
